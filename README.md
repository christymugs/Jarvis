# AI Assistant (Jarvis)

**Description:**  
AI Assistant (Jarvis) is a Python-based project that implements a voice-controlled assistant capable of performing various tasks, including playing music, providing time and date information, fetching information from Wikipedia, telling jokes, and solving math problems.

## Key Contributions

- **Voice Interaction:** Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to recognize voice commands from the user.
- **Task Execution:** Performs tasks based on user commands, such as playing music on YouTube, fetching information from Wikipedia, and solving math problems.
- **Continuous Conversation:** Implements a conversational loop structure to allow continuous interaction with the user until an exit command is received.
- **Error Handling:** Incorporates error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and graceful handling of exceptions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Proficiency in Python programming language
- Knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for voice recognition
- Regular expressions for text processing
- Error handling and debugging

## Impact

The AI assistant project showcased my ability to develop practical applications utilizing AI technologies. It demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail in implementing features, and effective communication through voice interaction. The project provided a hands-on learning experience in AI development and enhanced my understanding of voice-controlled systems and their applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `speech_recognition`, `pywhatkit`, `wikipedia`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/jarvis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd jarvis
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install speech_recognition
    pip install pywhatkit
    pip install wikipedia
    
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python jarvis.py
    ```

2. Start speaking commands when prompted. For example:

    - "Play Despacito"
