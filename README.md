AI Assistant (Jarvis)

Description:
AI Assistant (Jarvis) is a Python-based project that implements a voice-controlled assistant capable of performing various tasks, including playing music, providing time and date information, fetching information from Wikipedia, telling jokes, and solving math problems.

Key Contributions:

Voice Interaction: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize voice commands from the user.
Task Execution: Performs tasks based on user commands, such as playing music on YouTube, fetching information from Wikipedia, and solving math problems.
Continuous Conversation: Implements a conversational loop structure to allow continuous interaction with the user until an exit command is received.
Error Handling: Incorporates error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and graceful handling of exceptions.
Skills Demonstrated:

Proficiency in Python programming language
Knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for voice recognition
API integration and usage
Regular expressions for text processing
Error handling and debugging
Impact:
The AI assistant project showcased my ability to develop practical applications utilizing AI technologies. It demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail in implementing features, and effective communication through voice interaction. The project provided a hands-on learning experience in AI development and enhanced my understanding of voice-controlled systems and their applications.
